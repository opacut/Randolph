# Polls

[GitHub polls](https://app.gh-polls.com/) - generates a simple poll in Markdown format

Here you can add anything you'd like to quickly know others' opinion for, or settle with a vote. 
Ideally not a lot of diverse options, since there's just four of us.

## Example
#### This is a great idea â€“ and it wouldn't be inaccurate to assume that I couldn't exactly not say that it is or isn't almost partially incorrect.
